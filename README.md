## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me strengthen my CSS layout skills, particularly with Flexbox, and practice building a responsive component. Here’s an example of a CSS snippet I’m proud of:

```css
main button:hover {
  background-color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
  color: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to:

Focus more on accessibility (e.g., using ARIA attributes for interactive elements).
Explore CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
